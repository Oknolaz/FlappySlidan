# FlappySlidan
This game is written in Python using the PyGame module. It is dedicated to the Ukrainian youtuber Slidan. I apologize for the low resolution, but the game was originally created for mobile phones.  


For the game you need: 
Python 3 
PyGame module  



Management occurs with the space bar or the left mouse button.  Have a nice game ... and sorry for my English - I used machine translation
